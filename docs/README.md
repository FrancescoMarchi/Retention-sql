# 📊 Customer Retention & Risk Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes customer churn and retention patterns using **SQL + Power BI**.  
It identifies *why customers leave*, *which segments are most at risk*, and *how to intervene effectively*.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn represents a major loss for subscription-based businesses.  
Using a relational model of customer data and at-risk call lists, this dashboard tracks retention over time, segments customers by tenure and risk level, and pinpoints actionable drivers of churn.

The result is a **three-page executive dashboard** built in Power BI, combining SQL-extracted features with business-focused analytics.
